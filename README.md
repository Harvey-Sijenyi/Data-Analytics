Assessment Exercise

Imagine you're part of the recruitment department of a European football club. As their insights lead, you need to create tools that will assist the department in identifying young players with high potential and steer the recruitment department's discussion on which players to sign to rely heavily on objective data to complement their experienced subjective scouting, recruitment, and coaching expertise.

Please choose one of the data sets below to create something to share with us during your interview that would assist the recruitment department in making more informed decisions about player signings. Please be as creative as you would like, and feel free to research and use resources out there.

#Step-By-Step processes to follow
Components of the Tool:

Performance Metrics:

Collect and analyze on-field performance metrics of young players, such as goals scored, assists, pass completion rates, tackles won, interceptions, and more.
Compare these metrics with established benchmarks for players in similar positions and age groups to identify standout performers.
Physical Attributes:

Gather data on players' physical attributes, including height, weight, speed, agility, and endurance.
Use this data to assess whether a player's physical characteristics align with the positional requirements of the team.
Statistical Analysis:

Utilize advanced statistical modeling to predict a player's future performance based on historical data and performance trends.
This could involve using machine learning algorithms to forecast a player's potential development trajectory.
Video Analysis:

Incorporate video analysis software to evaluate a player's skills, decision-making, and tactical awareness.
Identify strengths and weaknesses through video clips from matches and training sessions.
Injury History:

Keep track of a player's injury history and recovery times.
Assess the impact of injuries on a player's long-term potential.
Personality and Work Ethics:

Conduct personality assessments and interviews to gauge a player's mentality, attitude, and work ethic.
Evaluate how well a player fits into the club's culture and values.
Scouting Reports:

Integrate qualitative scouting reports from experienced scouts and coaches.
Combine subjective insights with objective data to create a holistic player profile.
Visualization and Decision Support:

Create an interactive dashboard that presents all the gathered data in a user-friendly format. The dashboard should include:

Player profiles with a summary of key statistics and attributes
Visualizations such as radar charts, heatmaps, and performance trend graphs
A player comparison tool to evaluate multiple prospects side by side
A recommendation engine that assigns a potential rating to each player based on the collected data.
Scoring and Ranking:

Develop a scoring system that quantifies a player's potential based on the collected data. This scoring system should be customizable, allowing the recruitment committee to assign different weights to different attributes based on their priorities.

Benefits:

Empower the recruitment department with objective data to support their decision-making process.
Allows for systematic player comparisons and trend analysis.
Helps identify undervalued talents and reduce the risk of signing underperforming players.
Promotes data-driven discussions within the recruitment committee.

#Performance Metrics:

Extract relevant performance metrics such as goals scored, assists, pass completion rates, tackles won, interceptions, and more from SkillCorner's Open Data repository.
Physical Attributes:

Gather data on players' physical attributes, including height and weight, from the repository if available.
Statistical Analysis:

Utilize historical performance data from the repository to create statistical models that predict a player's future performance.
Video Analysis:

You can access video clips and match data from SkillCorner's Open Data repository to evaluate a player's skills, decision-making, and tactical awareness.
Injury History:

While injury history data might not be available directly from this repository, you can cross-reference it with other injury databases or sources.
Personality and Work Ethics:

Personality assessments and interviews would require additional data collection and may not be available from SkillCorner's Open Data repository.
Scouting Reports:

Combine the quantitative data obtained from the repository with qualitative scouting reports from experienced scouts and coaches
